### Getting Started ###

Have node 4+ and npm 3+.

```
node --version
npm --version
```

Start the server.

```
npm install
npm start
```

Don't worry about the warnings about fsevents during the install step,
since it seems to work without it.

The start step will start a local web server, and load the page in the
browser. This will also reload assets when they are changed, so that you
see changes almost immediately.
